The Tunisian Company of Electricity and Gas (STEG) has suffered significant financial losses due to fraudulent manipulations of meters by consumers. This project aims to detect and recognize clients involved in such fraudulent activities using their billing history. By leveraging the LightGBM model, we can enhance the company's revenues and reduce losses caused by these activities. The solution is deployed using Flask for local development and Azure for cloud deployment.
